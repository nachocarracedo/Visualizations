## Visualize progress of a project

Project where I show some visualizations (using matplotlib) I did at work for different projects.

* 1) [loads.py](): 
[GOAL] Management wanted a daily report of the CPU loads of a cluster.
[SOLULTION] I set up a script on the cluster that runs on a cron schedule. Then, this python script will get that data from a shared folder, parse it, and plot it. 
[RESULT]

* 2) (visualization_sfa_project.ipynb)[]: 
[GOAL] Project manager wanted a visualization that showed the current status of a migration project to show to stakeholders
[SOLUTION] This notebook visualizes data to show the progress of a project.
[RESULT]
