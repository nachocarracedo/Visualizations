## Visualize progress of a project

This notebook (visualization_sfa_project.ipynb) visualizes data to show the progress of a project. Stakeholders gave me some guidelines of what they wanted to see (one was the pie chart!). The project itself consisted of data migration of 48 shared folders.
All is done using matplotlib.

Enjoy!
